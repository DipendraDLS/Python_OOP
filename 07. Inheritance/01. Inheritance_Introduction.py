'''
- The mechanism of deriving a new class from an old an old one(existing class) such that the new class inherit all the members
  (variables and method) of old class is called inheritance or derivation.

- All classes in python are built from a single super class called 'object'. so whenever we create a class in python, object will become super class for them internally.

- Eg:
    class Mobile(object):
           or
    class Mobile:
    
- The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability.
