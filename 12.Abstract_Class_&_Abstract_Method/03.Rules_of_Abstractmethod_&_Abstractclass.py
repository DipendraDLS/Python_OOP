- It is not necessarry to declare all methods abstract in an abstract class.
- Abstract class can have abstract method and concrete methods.
- If there is any abstract method in a class, that class must be defined in its child class/subclass.
- If you are inheriting any abstract class that have abstract method, you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.
