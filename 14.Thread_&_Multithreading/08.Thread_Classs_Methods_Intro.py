Thread Class's Methods

1. start(): Once a thread is created it should be started by calling start() Method

2. run(): Every thread will run this method when thread is started. We can override this method and write our own code as body of the run() Method. A thread will terminate automatically when it comes out of the run() method.

3. join(): This method is used to wait till the thread completely executes the run() method.
